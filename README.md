## AccountaBee

AccountaBee is a mobile app that lets you and your friends set weekly goals, check them off as the week progresses, and keep each other socially accountable. With a feed that updates you on your friends' progress, you can encourage and applaud each others' efforts and achieve your goals together.

## Technologies

We developed AccountaBee with JavaScript, React Native, Expo, React Navigation, Redux, Firebase Authentication, and Victory.js.

Our [backend](https://https://github.com/AccountaBee/accountaBee-backend "AccountaBee Backend Repository") was created with Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and Sequelize, and deployed on Heroku.
