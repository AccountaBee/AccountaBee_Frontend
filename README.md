## AccountaBee

Socially accountable goal-setting for you and your friends!

AccountaBee is a mobile app that lets you and your friends set weekly goals, check them off as the week progresses, and keep each other socially accountable. With a feed that updates you on your friends' progress, you can encourage and applaud each others' efforts and achieve your goals together.
