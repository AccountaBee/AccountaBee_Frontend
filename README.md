We developed AccountaBee with JavaScript, React Native, Expo, Redux, Firebase Authentication, and Victory.js.

Our [backend](https://https://github.com/AccountaBee/accountaBee-backend "AccountaBee Backend Repository") was created with Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and Sequelize, and deployed on Heroku.
